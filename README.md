# Neighborhood Map Project (Hot Drinks, Cool Treats!)
Neighborhood Map project for Udacity Nanodegree. Creates a map (if the user chooses) displaying popular ice cream and coffee shops throughout the South-Central Austin area.

## Installation
Open index.html to open app.

## Usage
After maps and places load, either click a **Marker** or click a place from the places list to highlight a specific place. (The map should center on the place and display an **Info Window**, and the list should highlight the place clicked). Remember, list is scrollable, so if you don't see a highlighted place, scroll down the list to see it.

Places can be searched for in the provided search bar. The search bar searches for either category (any category associated with the place not just the displayed category from the **Info Window**) or the name itself. Searches are conducted in real time without pressing a **Submit Button** and are dynamically populated in the places list.

By default, the places list shows all places, but a **Hot Drinks** and **Cool Treats** filter can be applied to the results to further refine the search.

If using a mobile device, you must slide the places list into view via the navigation button or tapping on the **Hot Drinks, Cool Treats** header.

## Requirements
- Used Google Maps API to provide markers on maps
- Populated more than 5 locations asynchronously with data from Yelp using Fusion API (3rd Party API requirement).
- Followed the MVVM paradigm using Knockout.js.
- Active marker is animated with **BOUNCE** animation
- Info Window uses information derived from Yelp Fusion API
- A load screen is provided before map loads
- An error screen is shown if map or places do not load
- Places list responds to search and filters dynamically as well as any interaction with **Markers** on the map

## Notes
- Yelp's Fusion API is meant to be used on the server side, so this is a janky client-side implementation using a token (derived from my own API key and secret) and the cors-anywhere url to prevent the CORS error.
